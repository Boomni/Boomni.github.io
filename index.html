            <p>I recently discovered i've got passion for technology and software engineering. it wasn't an easy decision to change career and focus on getting the relevant skills required. But i was certain the software engineering path was for me. My search for a good software engineering training platform began</p>
        <h2>The Search:</h2>
            <p>I was particular about a sponsored program. I remember searching google and twitter a lot. I finally stumbled on an ad on twitter. It was too good to be true 'The ALX Software Engineering program'</p>

            <p>I applied and that same day i was accepted into the program. My program was to commence August 15, 2022.
            I was truely excited and that made me search various platforms concerning reviews about the ALX program. I got to understand their was a lot of task, projects, time commitment, hardwork and studies to be done.</p>
            <p>Vist the <a href="https://alxafrica.com">ALX platform</a> to learn more</p>
            
            <p>Then i decided to set my priorities right. Set my goals and be focused on constant development.</p>
            
         <h2>Twice Blessed!</h2>
            <p>I was also granted a scholarship for pro membership studies by the scrimba community. I was impressed with the scrimba platform and how interactive, simplified and interesting it was. This scholarship spored me a lot. I must say i'm so thankful for the opportunity.</p>
